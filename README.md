## What is Tontine?

Tontine is an application on MiniPay providing a new way of handling savings throught an incentivise pool, targeting emerging markets. It can also work with telegram miniapp. The App is deployed on the Celo blockhain

## Why Tontine ?

In emerging countries like south asia or africa, people are struggling to save money and are prone to gambling addiction. We leverage the concept of "tontine" (a community shared piggy bank concept that is used in the real world to help communities share their wealth and have access to more utilities)
Billions of people face these hard challenges and Tontine will enables them to easily save money and benefit from the rewards.
